# Debug Logs Added for Target Proposal Caching 🔍

## Console Logs Added to Track Caching Flow

Debug logs have been added to identify why proposals might regenerate instead of using cached data.

---

## How to Use These Logs

### 1. **Open Browser Console**
- Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux)
- Press `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
- Go to "Console" tab

### 2. **Test the Feature**
```
1. Open any report
2. Click "Целевое предложение" button
3. Wait for generation (first time)
4. Close modal
5. Click "Целевое предложение" again
```

### 3. **Watch the Console Output**

---

## Expected Log Flow

### **First Time (No Cache):**

```
📄 [Report API] Fetching report: abc-123-def
📄 [Report API] Target proposal cached: NO
📊 [Report Page] Target Proposal from DB: NULL
🎯 [Modal] Modal opened
🎯 [Modal] Existing proposal: NULL
🎯 [Modal] Current proposalText: EMPTY
⚡ [Modal] No cache found, calling API to generate...
🔄 [Modal] generateProposal() called
🔄 [Modal] Analysis ID: abc-123-def
🔄 [Modal] Calling API...

💾 [API] Received proposal generation request
💾 [API] Analysis ID: abc-123-def
💾 [API] Company: Example Company
💾 [API] Saving proposal to database...
💾 [API] Proposal length: 2543 characters
✅ [API] Target proposal saved successfully for analysis abc-123-def
✅ [API] Cached 2543 characters in database
💾 [API] Returning proposal to client

✅ [Modal] API response received, proposal length: 2543
✅ [Modal] Notifying parent component...
📊 [Report Page] Proposal generated, updating cache. Length: 2543

📊 [Report Page] Modal closed
```

### **Second Time (Should Use Cache):**

```
📄 [Report API] Fetching report: abc-123-def
📄 [Report API] Target proposal cached: YES (2543 chars)
📊 [Report Page] Target Proposal from DB: EXISTS
📊 [Report Page] Cached proposal length: 2543
🎯 [Modal] Modal opened
🎯 [Modal] Existing proposal: EXISTS (2543 chars)
🎯 [Modal] Current proposalText: EMPTY
✅ [Modal] Using cached proposal - NO API CALL

📊 [Report Page] Modal closed
```

---

## Debug Scenarios

### ✅ **Scenario 1: Cache Working Correctly**
```
📊 [Report Page] Target Proposal from DB: EXISTS
📊 [Report Page] Cached proposal length: 2543
🎯 [Modal] Modal opened
🎯 [Modal] Existing proposal: EXISTS (2543 chars)
✅ [Modal] Using cached proposal - NO API CALL
```
**Result:** ✅ Perfect! No API call, instant display

---

### ❌ **Scenario 2: Database Not Returning Cached Data**
```
📊 [Report Page] Target Proposal from DB: NULL
🎯 [Modal] Modal opened
🎯 [Modal] Existing proposal: NULL
⚡ [Modal] No cache found, calling API to generate...
```
**Problem:** Database doesn't have cached proposal

**Possible Causes:**
1. Migration not run (`npx prisma db push`)
2. Prisma client not regenerated (`npx prisma generate`)
3. Database column not created
4. API failed to save on first generation

**Solution:**
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

---

### ❌ **Scenario 3: API Not Saving to Database**
```
💾 [API] Received proposal generation request
💾 [API] Saving proposal to database...
❌ [API] Failed to save proposal to database: [error message]
```
**Problem:** API can't write to database

**Possible Causes:**
1. Prisma client not regenerated
2. Database connection issue
3. Invalid analysisId
4. Permissions issue

**Check:**
- Is `analysisId` valid?
- Is DATABASE_URL correct?
- Run `npx prisma generate` again

---

### ❌ **Scenario 4: Props Not Being Passed**
```
🎯 [Modal] Modal opened
🎯 [Modal] Existing proposal: NULL
```
*But you know it should be cached*

**Problem:** `existingProposal` prop not passed correctly

**Check in code:**
```tsx
<TargetProposalModal
  existingProposal={targetProposal}  // ← Is this passed?
  onProposalGenerated={handleProposalGenerated}  // ← Is this passed?
  analysisId={report.id}  // ← Is this passed?
/>
```

---

### ❌ **Scenario 5: State Not Updating After Generation**
```
✅ [Modal] API response received, proposal length: 2543
✅ [Modal] Notifying parent component...
[No log from Report Page]
```
**Problem:** Parent callback not working

**Check:**
- Is `onProposalGenerated` function defined?
- Is `setTargetProposal` being called?

## Log Prefixes Explained

| Prefix | Component | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| 📄 | Report API | Tracks database query for report data |
| 📊 | Report Page (Frontend) | Tracks state updates on frontend |
| 🎯 | Modal | Tracks modal opening and cache check |
| 🔄 | Modal (Generate) | Tracks API call initiation |
| 💾 | Proposal API | Tracks server-side generation and DB save |
| ✅ | All | Success messages |
| ❌ | All | Error messages |
| ⚡ | Modal | Important decision points |

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FIRST STEP

**Before testing, you MUST run these commands:**

```bash
# 1. Regenerate Prisma client (updates TypeScript types)
npx prisma generate

# 2. Push schema to database (creates column)
npx prisma db push

# 3. Restart dev server
# Stop with Ctrl+C, then:
npm run dev
```

**Without these steps, you will get TypeScript errors and caching won't work!**

---

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check Database Migration
```bash
# Verify schema is updated
cat prisma/schema.prisma | grep targetProposal

# Should show:
# targetProposal String? @db.Text
```

### Step 2: Verify Prisma Client
```bash
# Regenerate client
npx prisma generate

# Push to database
npx prisma db push
```

### Step 3: Check Database Directly
```sql
-- Check if column exists
SELECT column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'Analysis' 
AND column_name = 'targetProposal';

-- Check cached proposals
SELECT id, "companyName", 
       LENGTH("targetProposal") as proposal_length,
       "targetProposal" IS NOT NULL as has_cache
FROM "Analysis"
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 4: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Clear Browser Cache
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or clear cache completely

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: TypeScript error - 'targetProposal' does not exist
**Error message:**
```
Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'targetProposal' 
does not exist in type 'AnalysisSelect<DefaultArgs>'
```

**Solution:** 
```bash
npx prisma generate
```
This regenerates Prisma Client with updated TypeScript types.

---

### Issue: "analysisId is required" error
**Log to check:**
```
🔄 [Modal] Analysis ID: undefined
❌ [API] Missing analysisId parameter!
```

**Solution:** Make sure modal receives `analysisId` prop:
```tsx
<TargetProposalModal analysisId={report.id} />
```

---

### Issue: Always shows "NULL" from DB
**Log to check:**
```
📊 [Report Page] Target Proposal from DB: NULL
```

**Solutions:**
1. Run migration: `npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push`
2. Check if API saved successfully on first generation
3. Verify database connection

---

### Issue: API saves but next load still shows NULL
**Log to check:**
```
✅ [API] Cached 2543 characters in database
[Later...]
📊 [Report Page] Target Proposal from DB: NULL
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check if report endpoint returns `targetProposal` field
2. Verify Prisma client is regenerated
3. Check database directly with SQL

---

### Issue: Modal opens but always generates
**Log to check:**
```
🎯 [Modal] Existing proposal: NULL
[But you know it was cached]
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check if `existingProposal` prop is passed
2. Verify `targetProposal` state is set correctly
3. Check if state persists between modal opens

---

## Testing Checklist

After running migration, test this flow:

- [ ] Open report for FIRST time
- [ ] Check console: "Target Proposal from DB: NULL"
- [ ] Click "Целевое предложение"
- [ ] Check console: "No cache found, calling API to generate..."
- [ ] Wait for generation (~30 seconds)
- [ ] Check console: "Target proposal saved successfully"
- [ ] Close modal
- [ ] Check console: "Proposal generated, updating cache"
- [ ] Click "Целевое предложение" AGAIN
- [ ] Check console: "Existing proposal: EXISTS"
- [ ] Check console: "Using cached proposal - NO API CALL"
- [ ] Verify modal shows INSTANTLY (no loading)

---

## What to Send for Debugging

If caching still doesn't work, send these logs:

1. **Full console output** from opening report to closing modal (twice)
2. **Database query result:**
   ```sql
   SELECT "targetProposal" 
   FROM "Analysis" 
   WHERE id = 'your-analysis-id';
   ```
3. **Prisma schema** (just the Analysis model)
4. **Error messages** (if any)

---

## Expected Performance

### With Working Cache:
- **First view:** 30 seconds (API generation)
- **Second view:** 0 seconds (instant from cache)
- **API calls:** 1 (only first time)
- **Cost:** $0.0024 (only first time)

### If Cache Not Working:
- **Every view:** 30 seconds
- **Every view:** New API call
- **Every view:** $0.0024 cost

**If you see 30 seconds every time, caching is NOT working!**

---

## Files with Debug Logs

1. ✅ `app/api/analysis/report/[analysisId]/route.ts` - Database query (server)
2. ✅ `app/report/[id]/page.tsx` - Frontend state management
3. ✅ `app/components/TargetProposalModal.tsx` - Cache check and generation
4. ✅ `app/api/analysis/generate-proposal/route.ts` - Proposal generation and save

---

## Removing Debug Logs Later

Once caching works, you can remove/comment out the `console.log()` statements, or keep them for production debugging (they don't affect performance).

To remove:
```bash
# Search for debug logs
grep -r "console.log.*\[Report Page\]" app/report/
grep -r "console.log.*\[Modal\]" app/components/
grep -r "console.log.*\[API\]" app/api/
```

✅ **Clear prefixes** (📊, 🎯, 💾) for easy tracking  
✅ **Detailed messages** show exact flow  
✅ **No linter errors**  
✅ **Ready for testing**  

**Next step:** Run migration, test the feature, and check console output!
